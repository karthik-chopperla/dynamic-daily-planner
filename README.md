 ðŸ§  Dynamic Daily Planner Generator

An AI-powered productivity app that generates daily planners dynamically based on your time preferences, behavior feedback, and learning simulations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Learns your focus style from yesterday's productivity/stress
- Generates smart schedules (no static logic or APIs)
- Works on any device via web (Streamlit.app)
- Fully AI-generated code and logic
- Simulates learning with adaptive time blocks

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. User inputs their wake/sleep time, focus block, and priorities
2. App simulates learning from feedback (productivity & stress)
3. Dynamic planner is generated using simple ML-like adjustments

## ðŸŽ“ AI Lifecycle Demonstrated

- **Problem Definition**: People lack optimized, flexible planning
- **Live Data Generation**: All input is user-driven
- **Learning**: Simulated using user feedback patterns
- **Evaluation**: Adjusts based on performance
- **Real-time Output**: Adaptive plan generated live

## ðŸ›  Built With

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **GitHub**
